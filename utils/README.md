# Utils

Here we store utilities for common processes which are used across our data. For example, if we are commonly graphing 3D graphs, then we can define a `plot_3D` function, or if there's some commonly reutilized time-scale matching function, etc. Any form of commonly used processing utilities, we write them here and import elsewhere.
