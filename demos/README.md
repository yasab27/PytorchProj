# Demos

In this folder, build stand alone Jupyter Notebooks which can be used for sample demos of utilizing this repository. For example, if training multiple different classifiers, build stand alone notebooks showing off different classification methods (for example one based on GRUs vs LSTMs, etc. ). This doesn't meant that these notebooks shouldn't import in your custom networks and classes, but rather just show them off with results.
