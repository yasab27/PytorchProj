# Raw Data

This folder should store only raw data, such as .csv files, .jpg, .png, etc. assuming they're small enough to fit. It may be common to pickle this data. If so, overwrite this readme file to explain the process of unpackaging and reading in the files and how they were pickled. For example if I saved a .csv data in a `pandas.DataFrame` object, that should be explained here.
